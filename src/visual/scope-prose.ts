/**
 * The sentences that describe what was measured.
 *
 * These lived inline in the tool handler as three separate ternaries testing
 * `scope === "full_page"`. When a third enum value arrived, all three fell through to
 * the viewport arm, so `scope: "sequential"` returned whole-document NUMBERS wrapped in
 * first-screen PROSE: "VIEWPORT ONLY", "the page is 6.7 screens, so most of it was not
 * measured", and an abandonment figure explained as conditional on the first screen
 * while it was conditional on the whole document.
 *
 * The criterion covering it passed. The response did state a scope and did state its
 * conditional; both statements were false. That is the same defect the scope-echo bug
 * was -- a claim satisfied by being present rather than by being true -- displaced from
 * a number into a sentence.
 *
 * Extracting them here is what makes the property assertable: a test can ask for all
 * three scopes and check they differ and that none of them claims the wrong subject.
 * Left inline, the only available check was a regex over ternaries, which would have
 * passed on any chain that happened to mention the right words.
