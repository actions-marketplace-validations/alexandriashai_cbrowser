/**
 * Attention overlay for captured frames.
 *
 * Renders the model's predicted-attention map over each captured frame so a
 * recording can be watched with the attention structure visible, then handed to
 * the normal encoders as an ordinary frame sequence.
 *
 * WHY THIS USES THE DOM. Capture runs against a LIVE page, so the DOM is right
 * there — and `analyzeAttention` blends 35% bottom-up colour contrast with 65%
 * DOM semantics (element type x persona priority x goal relevance). Overlaying
 * the bottom-up half alone would paint the one component that has been
 * benchmarked and LOST: on 495 web pages against real human fixations it scored
 * AUC 0.585 versus a plain centre-bias baseline's 0.658. Passing DOM elements
 * makes this the actual production attention model rather than the weakest
 * quarter of it. Falls back to visual-only when no DOM is supplied, and says so
 * in the result.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES AND DOES NOT ESTABLISH. With DOM this is the product's attention
 * prediction — legitimately what cbrowser computes and sells. It is not a
 * *validated* gaze prediction: the semantic layer carrying most of the blend has
 * never been tested against human eye movements in either direction, which is
 * what the primary collection study is being built to settle. So "predicted
 * attention" is accurate; "where users look" asserts an accuracy nobody has
 * measured yet. (2026-07-30)
 *
 * Cost: one attention pass per frame, roughly 0.5-1s each at typical viewport
 * sizes. A 5s capture at 10fps is ~50 frames, so budget 30-60s. That is why
 * this is opt-in and never the default.
