/**
 * Frame-capture engine for screen recordings.
 *
 * Chromium capture goes through the CDP screencast (`Page.startScreencast`),
 * which is **event-driven, not clocked**: the browser emits a frame when the
 * page paints, so a static page emits nothing at all. Three consequences run
 * through this whole file:
 *
 * - The clock is wall time. Every frame is stamped at receipt, and playback
 *   delays are derived from those stamps. Nothing is ever synthesised to fill
 *   a quiet stretch; quiet stretches are recorded as `frame_gaps`.
 * - A recording always brackets its window with a directly-captured frame at
 *   the start and (when the stream has gone quiet) at the end, so a completely
 *   static page still produces a valid recording rather than an empty one.
 * - Frames stream to disk as they arrive. Nothing accumulates the full frame
 *   set in memory, so recording length is bounded by disk, not RAM.
 *
 * Screencast frames arrive full-viewport - CDP takes no clip parameter - so
 * the frames on disk are always the whole viewport. Cropping is a post-hoc
 * concern, which is what keeps a recording re-croppable after the fact.
 *
 * Firefox and WebKit have no screencast; they fall back to a screenshot loop.
 *
 * @since v18.70.0
