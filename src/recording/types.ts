/**
 * Recording manifest contract.

 * was captured, what was captured, and every frame that made it into the
 * output. Encoders, the CLI, and any downstream consumer read this file rather
 * than re-deriving state from the frame directory.
 *
 * Schemas are zod v4; every exported TS type is inferred from its schema so the
 * runtime contract and the compile-time contract cannot drift.

/**
 * Manifest format version emitted by this build.
 *
 * v2 (2026-07-19) added the two-tier change signal: `key_frames`,
 * `change_points_saturated` and `ssim_thresholds`, all OPTIONAL in the schema
 * (expand-contract, so older files keep parsing) but always emitted, so
 * `version >= 2` reliably signals their presence.
 *
 * v3 (2026-07-19) changed the DETECTOR behind those fields from global SSIM to
 * {@link SSIM_THRESHOLDS} window-min ({@link changeScore}), and re-tuned the
 * thresholds to the new scale (0.999/0.9 -> 0.95/0.6). The field shapes are
 * unchanged, but a v3 `change_points` is not numerically comparable to a v2
 * one — the version is the signal for that, since the values in
 * `ssim_thresholds` alone cannot convey that the underlying metric changed.
 * Readers wanting a uniform view across versions should use {@link changeSignal}.

/**
 * Change-detection thresholds for the two-tier signal.
 *
 * These are measured against the {@link changeScore} scale (minimum SSIM over an
 * 8x8 window grid on a 128px signature), NOT global SSIM. The scale is entirely
 * different from a whole-frame metric and the two are not interchangeable — a
 * localized text change reads ~0.87 under changeScore versus ~0.9998 under
 * global SSIM. The producer MUST feed these thresholds changeScore values;
 * `ssim_thresholds` records them in every manifest so a reader never guesses.
 *
 * `CHANGE` (0.95) — "did anything change". Below the practical noise floor
 * (an unchanging page scores exactly 1.0; window-min does not fire on codec
 * noise) and above a 12px counter tick (~0.87), which is the localized change
 * global SSIM could not see at any resolution.
 *
 * `KEY` (0.6) — "did something notable happen". The sparse tier, and the same
 * signal that sets each frame's `anomaly` flag. It sits in the wide gap between
 * a minor tick (~0.87, excluded) and a real interaction like a form fill
 * (~0.21, included), so background chrome does not flood it. Because KEY <
 * CHANGE, `key_frames` is necessarily a subset of `change_points`;
 * {@link changeSignalIssues} checks a manifest honours it.
 *
 * Derived from measurement on five fixtures (static / ticking counter / two
 * form fills / banner toggle / full-viewport animation), 2026-07-19. The
 * counter fixture is why the two tiers matter: change_points fires on every
 * tick and saturates, while key_frames stays empty — so key_frames is the
 * usable signal precisely when change_points is not.
