/**
 * What a persona must account for before it can be submitted.
 *
 * THE PROBLEM
 *
 * `persona_create_submit_traits` accepted whatever it was given. A caller who
 * named three traits got back a complete 26-trait persona, because
 * `buildTraitsFromAnswers` fills every unsupplied one from a research baseline.
 * The persona then looked finished from the outside — full trait vector, real
 * numbers, no warning in the payload — while most of those numbers were
 * population defaults nobody had considered for this person.
 *
 * Five personas on this install carry exactly that history: each is missing the
 * same four traits (selfEfficacy, satisficing, trustCalibration,
 * interruptRecovery), which means one creation session skipped them and nothing
 * asked. Filling them afterwards is archaeology — reading the description months
 * later and hoping it still supports a number.
 *
 * THE RULE
 *
 * Every trait must be ACCOUNTED FOR at submission: either given a value, or
 * named explicitly as something the description does not support. Both are fine
 * answers. Silence is not, because silence and "0.5 is genuinely right here"
 * produce the same persona and nothing downstream can tell them apart.
 *
 * This is the same contract the Big Five inference already uses — supply it with
 * evidence, or omit it deliberately and let the caller know what that costs.
 *
 * WHY REJECT RATHER THAN WARN
 *
 * A warning in a response is read once, by a model that has already moved on to
 * the next tool call. The persona is written either way, and the gap is only
 * discovered when someone audits months later. Refusing the write is the only
 * version of this that changes what gets stored.
