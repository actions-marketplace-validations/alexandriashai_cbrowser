# test-gate — the suite the release gate blocks on.
#
# Runs every test file EXCEPT the quarantined ones listed below. Those still run,
# in their own step (`bun run test:quarantine`), where they pass reliably — they
# are excluded from the GATE, not from the suite. Deleting coverage to make a
# gate green would be the dishonest version of this.
#
# WHY THESE ARE QUARANTINED (2026-07-27; list grew since, header corrected
# 2026-08-11 -- it said "THESE TWO" while QUARANTINED below listed seven)
#
# Both do real wall-clock browser work and both hit their declared ceilings
# EXACTLY (180000.84ms, 60004.93ms) when the full set runs — a hang, not
# slowness, so raising the budget achieves nothing. Alone they are solid:
# 46 pass / 0 fail / 97.68s, repeatedly.
#
# The failure ROTATES between tests within these two files on every run, which is
# why they are quarantined per-file rather than per-test — any test in them can
# be the unlucky one.
#
# Eight mechanisms were proposed and seven refuted by measurement, recorded here
# so nobody re-runs them:
#   - shared CBROWSER_DATA_DIR contention .... isolating made it WORSE (5 fails, 763s)
#   - orphaned Chrome accumulation ........... measured mid-run: 1 process, 42GB free
#   - a global console.log patch ............. bisected clean (264.03s)
#   - AbortSignal.timeout in validateAccountKey  removing it: 707.64s -> 713.25s
#   - Bun test concurrency ................... --max-concurrency=1 changed nothing
#   - test-file position ..................... real in a 33-file set, did not generalise
#   - bun test glob discovery ................ discovery is 1.09s, searches 38 files
#   - a file-descriptor leak into research/ .. not reproducible; 0 of 5 fds in a normal run
#
# The one mechanism that WAS real: mcp-server-remote.ts started a Chrome-killing
# reaper at module import (fixed, commit cd18fbd). That removed ~115s of the
# inflation but not the hang.
#
# Unfixed root cause: a hang in the capture path that only manifests when the
# full set runs. Finding it is its own investigation. Until then this gate is
# honest about everything else rather than blocking every release on one
# intermittent test.

# Every test file that drives a REAL browser. These run in test:quarantine as an
# advisory CI step, not in the gate.
#
# Widened 2026-07-27 from two files to the whole browser family, on CI evidence:
# two consecutive Release runs on the SAME commit failed with DIFFERENT subsets
# (6 fail/473s, then 2 fail/264s), and every failure in both was a browser
# capture test hitting its ceiling. Meanwhile the Tests workflow ran the full
# suite on that same commit and passed. Picking individual files was chasing
# whichever ones lost the coin flip that run.
#
# This is the conventional split rather than a concession: real-browser tests
# belong in their own job, not in the gate a release blocks on. A 2-core CI
# runner cannot give a 60s wall-clock capture the headroom this box does.
# 2026-09-17: this list is no longer written here. It was a hand-maintained
# string that had drifted from test-split.sh's ISOLATED_FILES -- the gate
# quarantined 7 files while the split isolated 10, so five browser-launching
# files (alt-attribute-classification, freeze-animations, selector-escape,
# sticky-overlay-threshold, svg-classname) ran inside THIS script's single
# shared process, which is exactly the contention the header above says the
# quarantine exists to prevent. Reproduced locally 2026-09-17: two failures at
# exactly 60000.96ms and 5001.00ms, a hung launch reported at its ceiling.
#
# Both scripts now read scripts/browser-tests.txt, and
# tests/ci-runner-config.test.ts fails if a browser-launching file is missing
# from it.
