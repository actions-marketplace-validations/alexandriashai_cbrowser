/**
 * Two fields that looked like they did nothing, and did not.
 *
 * BUG-12 · `crowdingSensitivity` was reported as "either unused or
 * used-and-unreported". It is used, twice: weighted 0.15 into readingCapacity,
 * and priced per text block. It was invisible because Pelli's critical-spacing
 * effect only begins below 16px and every page tested set body text at 16px or
 * larger, so the penalty evaluated to exactly 0 and the prose list -- which
 * gates every component behind its own threshold -- simply omitted it.
 *
 * Absent and unmodelled looked identical. That is the defect, not the zero.
 *
 * BUG-08 · `decisionStyle` was emitted behind a TRUTHINESS guard, so the one
 * case it needed to describe -- null, because the top two styles were within
 * threshold -- was the case where the key vanished. The payload shipped
 * `decisionStyleSource: "suppressed"` describing a field it had omitted.
 *
 * @since 2026-08-03
