/**
 * Splitting `motor` into target acquisition and sequence execution.
 *
 * Same failure shape as the pre-R5 readability layer: one scalar carrying two
 * mechanisms while the inspectable sub-metric tracks only one of them. Measured
 * on identical demand before the split:
 *
 *   motor-impairment-tremor  cost 0.072  hitProbability 48.4%
 *   elderly-user             cost 0.107  hitProbability 81.9%
 *
 * Worse pointing, lower cost -- because tremor's proceduralFluency (0.60)
 * outweighed its pointing deficit against elderly's (0.40).
 *
 * NO WEIGHTING WAS INVENTED. Both layers contribute additively like every other
 * layer, which makes their relative contribution visible instead of hidden. The
 * calibration slot exists, is named, defaults to 1.0 each, and is marked
 * uncalibrated.
