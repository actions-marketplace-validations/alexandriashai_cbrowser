/**
 * The MCP gate and the CMS billing layer must agree about what is free.
 *
 * They did not. Measured 2026-08-13, the CMS permitted 18 tools that this gate
 * refused, so a free user was told they had the tool and then got "Upgrade
 * Required" from the server. Two of those were agent_ready_audit and hunt_bugs
 * — the tools the public homepage demo runs, which is how it surfaced: the demo
 * was dead and the error blamed the key's tier.
 *
 * Root cause was structural, not a typo: pricing was read off TOOL_CATEGORIES,
 * which groups tools by FUNCTION. A tool could not be priced free unless every
 * functional sibling was, so `agent_ready_audit` inherited "pro" from the
 * category it shares with genuinely-Pro analysis tools.
 *
 * WHERE THE CROSS-REPO CHECK LIVES, and why not here: this file used to read
 * the CMS's list from an absolute path (/home/wyld-web/static/cbrowser-web/...).
 * That path exists only on the deployment box, so on a CI runner the read threw
 * and took down both the Tests workflow and the RELEASE GATE — which is why
 * npm sat at 19.1.3 while this very fix was unpublished. A public package's
 * tests must not reach into a private repo's filesystem.
 *
 * So the comparison lives on the CMS side, which legitimately knows about both.
 * This file asserts only what the package can prove about itself.
