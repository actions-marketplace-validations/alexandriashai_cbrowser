/**
 * Two numbers a customer reads side by side, and what they were actually saying.
 *
 * BUG-17: `interpretation` said "should handle this page comfortably" next to a
 * 39% abandonment risk. That looked like two independent measures disagreeing.
 * It was not. Abandonment was a logistic centred at 1.5x tolerance, and a
 * logistic evaluated below its centre still returns a substantial value, so
 * every persona carried a floor no page could lower:
 *
 *   persona          risk on a page costing them NOTHING
 *   impatient-user   40%     cognitive-adhd 34%     power-user 25%
 *   elderly-user     11%     perfect patience 8%
 *
 * Across the real deficit range on these pages (0 to 0.28) cognitive-adhd moved
 * 34% -> 45%: an 11-point span sitting on a 34-point floor. The number was ~85%
 * constant. Folding it into the verdict, which is what was recommended, would
 * have imported that constant into the sentence.
 *
 * BUG-18: `readability` reports a bare 0 whenever decoding capacity exceeds
 * demand, so it cannot distinguish 91% legibility from 99%. The floor is right;
 * reporting nothing but the floor is not.
