/**
 * CI must run the split runner, not the single-process union.
 *
 * `test.yml` ran `bun test --coverage` — the whole suite in one process, which
 * is exactly the configuration `scripts/test-split.sh` exists to avoid. Browser-
 * launching files accumulate something across a long-lived `bun test` until a
 * launch hangs, and which test times out is random.
 *
 * release.yml's own comments name this hazard ("the exact configuration
 * scripts/test-split.sh exists to avoid") while test.yml kept doing it, so the
 * lesson was written down and not applied one file over. This test applies it.
