/**
 * Whose surplus costs, and whose does not.
 *
 * Billing surplus at 0.3 across every dimension meant a persona was charged for
 * being MORE capable than the page required. Measured on a mid-density page
 * before this change, SEVENTY PERCENT of `power-user`'s total cost was surplus,
 * and a uniform-capacity sweep produced a U:
 *
 *   capacity  0.2    0.4    0.6    0.8    1.0
 *   cost      0.549  0.081  0.076  0.179  0.516
 *
 * A maximally capable persona scored almost exactly as badly as a maximally
 * impaired one, for opposite reasons, and nothing in the output distinguished
 * them.
 *
 * THE RULE: surplus is FREE where a dimension's own `highEnd` names an ABILITY,
 * BILLED where it names a TENDENCY, BIAS or SUSCEPTIBILITY. It is derivable
 * from the trait reference rather than chosen, which is what makes it
 * defensible and what lets a future dimension be classified without a debate.
