/**
 * The manifest a client reads, checked against the handler it fronts.
 *
 * An external report filed four findings that all reduced to "the served schema does
 * not match the code". Three were wrong -- the schemas were correct and the process
 * serving them was old -- and the fourth was right for a string nobody had checked.
 * Being wrong three times out of four is the point: there was no way to settle any of
 * it except by hand, so a reasonable reader inferred a plausible mechanism and got it
 * backwards.
 *
 * The existing coverage cannot settle it either, and it is worth being precise about
 * why, because both files LOOK like they cover this:
 *
 *   tests/measurement-scope.test.ts        regex-matches the SOURCE TEXT of the
 *                                          registration files. Green while the wire
 *                                          serves something else entirely.
 *   tests/mcp-schema-handler-drift.test.ts checks one direction only -- a schema key
 *                                          the handler never binds. The opposite
 *                                          direction, a parameter the handler READS
 *                                          that no schema declares, is what makes a
 *                                          documented parameter unreachable, and it
 *                                          was uncovered.
 *
 * This file assembles the real registry in-process -- the same registerAllPublicTools
 * the server calls, against a recording stand-in -- and asserts against the objects
 * tools/list is generated from. No HTTP, so it runs in CI.
 *
 * What it deliberately does NOT do is verify the RUNNING server. It cannot: a test
 * proves things about the code it imports, and the live failure was a process running
 * older code. That is a different question with a different probe --
 * scripts/check-deploy-freshness.mjs and tests/deploy-freshness.test.ts -- and
 * conflating the two is how "the tests pass" came to be read as "the customer sees
 * this".

/**
 * Assemble the manifest, calling the registrars DIRECTLY.
 *
 * Not `registerAllPublicTools`, and the reason is the whole value of this file. That
 * entry point composes two proxies around the server before registering -- a tier
 * gate and a security layer -- and the security layer replaces every handler with
 * `async (params) => { ... }`. So a manifest built through it carries 129 wrappers,
 * every one of which destructures nothing, and a check that reads handler parameters
 * skips all 129 and reports the codebase clean.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical. The first version of this file did exactly that and
 * passed 5/5 while `scope` was deleted from cognitive_effort's schema underneath it.
 * It was caught only by removing the mechanism and watching for red, which is the one
 * procedure that distinguishes a guard from a green check.
 *
 * Registering directly gives the handlers as written. It also means this file must
 * name the four registrars `registerAllPublicTools` composes; the count assertion
 * below is what fails if that list drifts, rather than the coverage silently shrinking.
 *
 * Handlers are never invoked, so the context can be stubs.
