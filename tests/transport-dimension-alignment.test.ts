/**
 * The three vectors the transport chain runs on must line up.
 *
 * A persona's capacity lives in COGNITIVE_TRAITS. A page's demand lives in
 * DEMAND_DIMENSIONS. Cost is transport between them, attributed to whichever of
 * the six layers claims that dimension in LAYER_DEFINITIONS. A dimension missing
 * from any one of the three is silently inert: it is read, carried, and then
 * contributes nothing, with no error anywhere.
 *
 * That is not theoretical. `siteFamiliarity` was missing from TWO of them
 * (2026-08-02). It was a member of COGNITIVE_TRAITS, so every persona carried a
 * value and the tool accepted a per-run parameter for it — and three runs at
 * familiarity unset, 1 and 0 returned byte-identical results across all six
 * layers, every interaction term, and every derived field, while the response
 * attested `siteFamiliaritySource: "supplied for this run"`. The parameter was
 * never overridden by anything. Nothing ever asked for it.
 *
 * The behavioural test below is the one that would have caught it, and it is
 * the check that was missing when the parameter shipped: not "was the input
 * accepted" but "did the output move".
