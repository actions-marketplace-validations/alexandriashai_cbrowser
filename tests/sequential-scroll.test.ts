/**
 * Scoring a page as a sequence of screens rather than one aggregate.
 *
 * The aggregate asks what the whole document would cost if it were all
 * processed. Almost nobody does that. This asks how far someone gets.
 *
 * THE TRAP THIS AVOIDS. Dividing a fixed total across k screens makes long
 * pages safer than short ones: a deficit of 0.607 split fourteen ways takes
 * cumulative abandonment from 22% to 2%, because the hazard is superlinear.
 * A genuinely sparse long page SHOULD be safer -- that is true, not an artifact
 * -- but a dense one must not become safe by being tall. So each screen is
 * measured on its own content, and the tests below use different content per
 * screen rather than a synthetic split.
