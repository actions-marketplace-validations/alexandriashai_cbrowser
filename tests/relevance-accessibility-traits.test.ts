/**
 * Accessibility traits must reach the LLM relevance judge.
 *
 * The judge received `traits` (the 25 cognitive ones) and not
 * `accessibilityTraits` — a separate vector holding sensory, motor and
 * executive-function values. That is the wrong half to drop for a layer whose
 * entire job is deciding what a person attends to and reads, and this codebase
 * says so itself: `persona-comparison-tools.ts` names
 * `accessibility_traits.attentionSpan` the AUTHORITATIVE source for attention,
 * with `traits.interruptRecovery` only a fallback, and the decoding traits
 * authoritative for reading.
 *
 * Measured on the persona modelling an ADHD user: attentionSpan 0.30,
 * processingSpeed 0.40, fatigueSusceptibility 0.30 — the three values that
 * define her — were exactly the ones the judge never saw. It was told she has
 * high curiosity and comprehension, and not told she cannot hold a line of text.
